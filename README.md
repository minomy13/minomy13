### Thats me!

Hey! Nice to meet you! My name is Adrian and here I want to introduce you to myself. For further information you can visit [my Website](https://www.minomy13.de), but it's still under development.

#### Projects

My main project at the moment is [partlib.io](https://github.com/partlib-io), which is a software for organization and catalogization of electronic components. It will go open source soon.

Last but not least you can take a look at my DevCard. I love to read about all the stuff happening in the world of software development. I normally use Medium, so please don't be confused of the amount of articles read.
